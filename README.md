# developer-portfolio
I don't just build websites; I build tools that save businesses time.  This portfolio project demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between complex data logic and user-friendly web interfaces. It features an interactive simulation of my Python Data Cleaning script, allowing potential clients to see exactly how much manual work can be automated.
